# Firefox-userChrome

My personal userChrome/userContent, tailored for [Arc Dark KDE theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/arc-kde).

These are fully experimental and hosted here mainly as backups.

## Features

* Minimal mode: tabs, extension icons and controls in address bar are hidden by default. They'll be shown when hovering the address bar. This is to be used with [Tree Style Tab extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/).
* Dark theme in new tab, default error messages (due to connection issue and whatnots) and reader mode (only when dark mode is used). about:* pages are darkened too, but haven't been cleaned.
* Themed context menu.
* Colored folders in bookmark menu.
* etc.
