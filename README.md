# Firefox-userChrome

My personal userChrome/userContent, tailored for [Materia Dark KDE theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/materia-kde).

These are fully experimental and hosted here mainly as backups.

## Features

* Minimal mode: tabs are hidden by default. They will be shown when hovering the address bar. This is to be used with [Tree Style Tab extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/).
* Dark theme in built-in home and new tab pages, GitHub raw files, local files, blank pages (matches Firefox's built-in dark color scheme).
* Larger context menus (I may remove this in the future).
* Compact find bar (Ctrl+F).
* Borderless address and search bars.
* etc.

## To-do(s)

* Update dark color scheme for Reader mode (currently using an old color scheme based on Arc-Dark).

## TreeStyleTab.css

Open Tree Style Tab's preferences through Add-ons > Tree Style Tab > Preferences.

Enable Plain Dark theme in Appearance > Theme.

Then use the CSS file in Advanced > Extra style rules for sidebar contents.
