# Firefox-userChrome

My personal userChrome/userContent, tailored for [Materia Dark KDE theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/materia-kde).

These are fully experimental and hosted here mainly as backups.

## Features

* Minimal mode: tabs are hidden by default. They'll be shown when hovering the address bar. This is to be used with [Tree Style Tab extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/).
* Dark theme in new tab, default error messages (due to connection issue and whatnots) and reader mode (only when dark mode is used). `about:*` pages are darkened too, but haven't been cleaned.
* Themed context menu.
* etc.

## Known issues

* "Get Add-ons" window in `about:addons` is not themed.
* addons.mozilla.org is not themed (it should be part of this to theme it due to the fact that extensions can not tamper with this site).
* etc.
